# Learning about Infinite Scrolling in Webapp

I was learning about Infinite Scrolling and I saw a nicely written tutorial by this lady [Suyeon Kang](https://medium.com/suyeonme/react-how-to-implement-an-infinite-scroll-749003e9896a).

After going through it, I reaslised I could add something to the code to it her solution from adding previous search results with new results when user try to clear the previous search query and do another search with another query.

## Don't know what Infinite Scrolling mean?

Infinite Scroll is a technique that automatically adds the next page as the user scrolls down through content, more content is loaded. User donâ€™t need to wait for pages to preload. So infinite scroll can provide user a better experience [Source](https://medium.com/suyeonme/react-how-to-implement-an-infinite-scroll-749003e9896a).


P.S: Original code was written by [Suyeon Kang](https://github.com/suyeonme)
