# Learning about Infinite Scrolling in Webapp

I was learning about Infinite Scrolling and I saw a nicely written tutorial by this lady [Suyeon Kang](https://medium.com/suyeonme/react-how-to-implement-an-infinite-scroll-749003e9896a).

After going through it, I reaslised I could add something to the code to make it reload the search result when user try to clear the previous search query.

## Don't know what Infinite Scrolling mean?
Infinite Scroll is a technique that automatically adds the next page as the user scrolls down through content, more content is loaded. User donâ€™t need to wait for pages to preload. So infinite scroll can provide user a better experience [Source](https://medium.com/suyeonme/react-how-to-implement-an-infinite-scroll-749003e9896a).


P.S: Original code was written by [Suyeon Kang](https://github.com/suyeonme)
