# Learning about Infinite Scrolling in Webapp

I was learning about Infinite Scrolling and I saw a nicely written tutorial by this lady [Suyeon Kang](https://medium.com/suyeonme/react-how-to-implement-an-infinite-scroll-749003e9896a).

After going through it, I reaslised I could add something to the code to it her solution from adding previous search results with new results when user try to clear the previous search query and do another search with another query.

## Don't know what Infinite Scrolling mean?

Pagination vs Infinite scroll

Infinite Scroll is a technique that automatically load/ add more contents to the page when the user scrolls down through content. User donâ€™t need to wait for pages to preload or have to click next page. [Source](https://medium.com/suyeonme/react-how-to-implement-an-infinite-scroll-749003e9896a).


P.S: Original code was written by [Suyeon Kang](https://github.com/suyeonme)
